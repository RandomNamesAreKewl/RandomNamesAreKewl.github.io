<h2>Finishing up my website</h2>
<p>
    So, finally got around to finishing the main page of my website.
    Since beforehand, it was quite ugly. Now it's slightly less ugly.
    I've sholved the projects off to a separate page. Because I wanted
    to try making a blog. So, I'll try and make posts every now and then.
